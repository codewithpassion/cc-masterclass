When explaining, follow these rules:

1. **No jargon** - Replace technical terms with everyday words
2. **Use an analogy** - Compare to something from daily life (cooking, building, driving)
3. **Keep it short** - 3 sentences max for the core explanation
4. **One example** - Show a concrete, relatable example

Start with: "Think of it like..."
