The `playground/` directory is your sandbox for experimentation! This is where you can explore Claude Code features, test out the plugins, and get comfortable with the tools. Use this space to try ideas and learn without worrying about breaking anything.

### Boilerplate

The `cf-tanstack-start-clerk-drizzle/` directory contains a production-ready boilerplate that we'll use throughout the masterclass. This boilerplate is pre-configured with best practices and is the foundation for the projects we'll build together.

## Getting Started

Once you have the plugins installed, you're ready to start building amazing applications with Claude Code!

Happy coding! 🚀
